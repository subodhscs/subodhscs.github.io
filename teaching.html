        <h1> <strong>Teaching Assignments</strong></h1>
      <p>I enjoy teaching. I have been a teaching assistant for multiple courses in Mechanical Engineering throughout my graduate school career. I am always amazed by the curiosity, creativity and analytical thinking that young engineering students have.</p>

            "Subodh is one of the best and most helpful TA's I've had thus far. I learned a majority, if not all, the course material from Subodh (even though I went to every single lecture). He was always there to answer any questions I had and did so in a manner that was both thorough and professional. On one occasion, I had to stay after lab to complete the homework assignment, and he was extremely thoughtful and considerate. I am grateful for Subodh and his efforts to help me and everyone during lab. By far one of the best TA's I've ever had"

          about what he does and he is very invested in creating the most positive learning atmosphere possible. Many students came into this class with vast
          differences in their background of the topics. Subodh was able to meet everyone where they were at so that everyone was able to be successful and
          sufficiently challenged. He also constantly asked for feedback and criticism and was very invested in being the best possible TA he could be. I had an
          excellent experience in his lab and learned practical and applicable skills that I am excited to use in my career! Thanks for a great semester"

          especially good job at inspiring student interest. He knows what he is talking about and does an excellent job at clearly conveying material. He
          makes sure to make the lab exercises challenging, but not overwhelming and is very approachable and extremely helpful with individual questions."

          "Subodh seemed genuinely interested in helping students learn. He was always more than willing to answer questions and give tips for doing something in a better way. I also appreciated that he would often share with us how he designed something, but would then say that this is just ONE way to do it and encouraged us to be creative. It was also nice that he attended lecture and there was clear intent to coordinate the lab with what we learned in lecture."
